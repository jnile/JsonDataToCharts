# JsonDataToCharts

This project is made using the Charts.js project where the data of the chart changes based on a button click.

The program uses data from the `.csv` file which has been converted to `.json` using ___ .
The data can then be changed based on a button click which traverses through the data one click at a time.
When the data is changed, the chart is updated to display the new data rather than replacing the old chart.
